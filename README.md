# Zsh Terminal Webapp

Quick local dev for a zsh-themed terminal webapp built with Vite + React.

Run locally:

```bash
# install
npm install

# dev server
npm run dev

# build
npm run build

# preview built site
npm run preview
```

Usage inside the terminal UI:
- `help` — list commands
- `cat info.txt` — show contact info
- `whoami` — prints username
- `clear` — clears the terminal
- `projects` — lists projects
- `project <n>` — shows project details and thumbnail

Thumbnails are inline SVGs and are clickable (open project URL).
